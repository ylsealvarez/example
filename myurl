	<h1>Our Adoption Policy :</h1>

	<p>Each dog we rescue is important to us and we are committed to its welfare and happiness. <br>All of our dogs are veterinary checked, vaccinated, neutered/spayed, microchipped, de-fleaed and wormed.<br>We never put down a healthy dog – by ‘healthy’ we mean a dog in good mental and physical health – as we think that if a dog can be <br>rehomed without danger to the public and live a happy, pain-free life, then everything possible should be done to avoid euthanasia.
	<p>We microchip all of our dogs. Microchipping is a very quick procedure which saves many dog’s lives <br>every year as a microchipped dog is far more likely to be reunited with its owners if it gets lost or stolen.</p>
